//   SubmitWithdrawal. A DEFINITE gateway refusal refunds the debit
//   immediately; an AMBIGUOUS submit error (timeout, reset — the payout may

// balance still shows it. The refund path shares the row's idempotency
// anchor, so a crash between debit and refund is recoverable by the
// reconcile sweep, never a double refund.
